# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.9] - 2025-06-05

### Changed

- **Client Configuration**: Removed the fallback to `mcp-config.json.example` in the client configuration loader, enforcing a stricter requirement for an explicit `mcp-config.json` file.
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated `.clinerules` (developer cheatsheet) with a detailed example of using the MCP client and a concrete example of tool registration.
  - Updated `README.md` to reflect the Hono migration and the stricter client configuration.
  - Updated `src/mcp-client/client-config/README.md` to clarify the removal of the configuration fallback.
  - Updated `src/mcp-server/README.md` to include the `imageTest` tool in the list of examples.

## [1.4.8] - 2025-06-05

### BREAKING CHANGE

- **HTTP Server Migration**: The HTTP transport layer in `src/mcp-server/transports/httpTransport.ts` has been migrated from **Express.js to Hono**. This is a significant architectural change that improves performance and leverages a more modern, lightweight framework. While the external API remains the same, internal middleware and request handling logic have been completely rewritten.

### Added

- **Supabase Client**: Added a dedicated Supabase client service in `src/services/supabase/supabaseClient.ts` for robust interaction with Supabase services.

### Changed

- **Configuration**: Overhauled `.env.example` to provide a more structured and comprehensive template for all server, transport, authentication, and service configurations.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Replaced `express` with `hono` and `@hono/node-server`.
  - Added `bcryptjs` and `pg` for future authentication and database integration.
  - Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to reflect these changes.
- **Authentication**: Refactored `src/mcp-server/transports/authentication/authMiddleware.ts` to be compatible with Hono's middleware context.
- **Documentation**: Updated `docs/tree.md` to reflect the new files and updated `src/mcp-server/README.md` to mention Hono.

## [1.4.7] - 2025-06-05

### Added

- **Configuration**: Added `.env.example` to provide a template for required environment variables.

### Changed

- **Build & Deployment**:
  - Significantly expanded `.dockerignore` to provide a more comprehensive and structured list of files and directories to exclude from Docker builds, improving build efficiency and security.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Updated various dependencies in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- **Code Quality**:
  - Minor code cleanup in `src/mcp-server/transports/httpTransport.ts` and `src/utils/internal/logger.ts`.
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated version to `1.4.7` in `README.md` and `package.json`.
  - Updated `docs/tree.md` with the latest file structure.

## [1.4.6] - 2025-06-04

### Changed

- **HTTP Transport Security (`src/mcp-server/transports/httpTransport.ts`)**:
  - Implemented rate limiting middleware for the MCP HTTP endpoint to protect against abuse.
  - Enhanced `isOriginAllowed` logic for more secure handling of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` headers, particularly for `null` origins.
- **Utilities**:
  - `idGenerator.ts`: Improved the `generateRandomString` method by implementing rejection sampling. This ensures a more uniform distribution of characters from the charset, enhancing the cryptographic quality of generated IDs.
  - `sanitization.ts`: Strengthened the `sanitizeUrl` method to disallow `data:` and `vbscript:` pseudo-protocols in addition to the already blocked `javascript:`, further reducing XSS risks.
- **Build & Versioning**:
  - Updated project version to `1.4.6` in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `README.md`.

## [1.4.5] - 2025-06-04

### Changed

- **Project Configuration**:
  - Updated `package.json`: Added `$schema` property for JSON Schema Store validation.
- **Client Transports**:
  - `stdioClientTransport.ts`: Refactored environment variable handling to only use explicitly defined environment variables from the server's configuration, removing the inheritance of the parent process's environment for improved security and predictability.
- **Server Tools**:
  - `catFactFetcher/logic.ts`:
    - Added comments highlighting best practices for configurable API URLs and timeouts.
    - Modified error logging for non-OK API responses to include the full `errorText` in `responseBodyBrief` instead of a truncated snippet.
  - `imageTest/registration.ts`:
    - Improved `RequestContext` handling during tool invocation to ensure better context linking and traceability.
    - Wrapped tool registration logic in `ErrorHandler.tryCatch` for consistent error management during server initialization.
- **Server Authentication**:
  - `authMiddleware.ts`: Implemented stricter validation for JWT `scope` or `scp` claims. The middleware now returns a 401 Unauthorized error if these claims are missing, malformed, or result in an empty scope array, enhancing security by ensuring tokens have necessary permissions.
- **Utilities**:
  - `logger.ts`:
    - Streamlined initialization by removing redundant log directory creation logic, now handled by the central configuration module (`src/config/index.ts`).
    - Ensured the `initialized` flag is set only after the logger setup is fully complete.
  - `idGenerator.ts`:
    - Enhanced the `isValid` method to use the `charset` provided in options (or the default charset) when building the validation regular expression. This makes ID validation more accurate, especially when custom character sets are used for generating IDs.
    - Added a JSDoc note to `normalizeId` regarding the behavior of `toUpperCase()` on the random part of an ID when custom charsets are involved.
  - `sanitization.ts`:
    - Updated JSDoc for `sanitizeInputForLogging` to detail the limitations of the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(input))` fallback method (used when `structuredClone` is unavailable), covering its impact on types like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `undefined` values, functions, `BigInt`, and circular references.
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated version badge in `README.md` to `1.4.5`.
  - Updated generation timestamp in `docs/tree.md`.

## [1.4.4] - 2025-06-04

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-01

This release focuses on integrating API documentation generation, enhancing the HTTP transport layer, and refining server initialization and logging.

- **API Documentation & Build**: Integrated TypeDoc for automated API documentation generation. Added `typedoc.json` configuration and a `docs:generate` script to `package.json`. Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the generated `docs/api/` directory and refreshed `README.md` and `docs/tree.md`. (Commit: `b1e5f4d` - approx, based on sequence)
- **MCP Types & Server Initialization**: Removed redundant local MCP type definitions (`src/types-global/mcp.ts`, `src/types-global/tool.ts`), relying on the SDK types. Refactored the main server entry point (`src/index.ts`) to initialize the logger _after_ configuration loading and used an async IIFE for startup. Improved JSDoc clarity in server, resource, and tool registration files. (Commit: `0459112`)
- **HTTP Transport & Logging Enhancements**:
  - Added stricter security headers (CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy) to HTTP responses.
  - Improved logging detail within the HTTP transport for origin checks, session handling, port checks, and request flow.
  - Made logger initialization asynchronous and added conditional console logging (active only when `MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug` and stdout is a TTY).
  - Implemented a workaround for an SDK `isInitializeRequest` check issue in the HTTP transport.
  - Changed the default HTTP port from 3000 to 3010.
  - Enhanced port conflict detection with proactive checks before binding.
  - Cleaned up minor logging inconsistencies. (Commit: `76bf1b8`)
