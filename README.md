# MCP HiveMQ prototype

A simple prototype of an [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for HiveMQ's MQTT Broker, based on a [Typescript template project](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template).

***
## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

This is a prototype and not intended for commercial or production use. Use is entirely at your own risk.   
I believe that AI tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) are not a good method of managing infrastructure generally as they are fundamentally non-deterministic. I also believe that most people who use them overestimate their ability 'reason' and the veracity of what they produce.  
This MCP server is built with this understanding - it is read-only, focused on extracting health and status data, and cannot be used to directly manage any aspect of the HiveMQ Broker.  

Even so, for example, the number of REST API calls, the contents of the REST calls it makes to the broker, and the tone and accuracy of the information it conveys are entirely probabilistic and may wildly vary based on the LLM client you are integrating it with. Where one LLM client may make 5 REST API calls, another may make 1. Where one LLM may describe your broker as 'healthy' based on its (probablistic, language-based) interpretation of the API response, another may describe it as 'down' or broken.

## üèÅ Quick Start

Get the example server running in minutes:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ryanbateman/hivemq-mcp#
    cd hivemq-mcp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    # Or use 'npm run rebuild' for a clean install (deletes node_modules, logs, dist)
    ```

4.  **Format the code (Optional but Recommended):**

    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```

5.  **Run the Server:**

    - **as an integration with Claude Desktop:**  
    Add it as a configured MCP server using Claude Desktop's settings (adjusting directory as necessary).
      ```json
      "hive_mcp":
        {
            "command": "node",
            "args":
            [
                "~/Documents/workspace/hivemq-mcp/dist/index.js"
            ],
            "env":
            {
                "LOG_LEVEL": "debug"
            }
        },
      ```
    - **Testing it via an MCP server inspector tool (useful for debugging):**
    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
    ```
    This will start an inspector tool that you can access on your localhost at `http://127.0.0.1:6274/`, which is useful for debugging tools, resources, prompts, etc. 
    - **Via Stdio (Default):** Many MCP host applications will run this automatically using `stdio`. To run manually for testing:
      ```bash
      npm start
      # or 'npm run start:stdio'
      ```
    - **Via Streamable HTTP:**
      ```bash
      npm run start:http
      ```
      This starts a **Streamable HTTP** server (default: `http://127.0.0.1:3010`) which uses Server-Sent Events for the server-to-client streaming component. The port, host, and allowed origins are configurable via environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### üî© Server Configuration (Environment Variables)

Configure the MCP server's behavior using these environment variables:

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                         | Default                                 |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE`      | Server transport: `stdio` or `http`.                                                                | `stdio`                                 |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT`           | Port for the HTTP server (if `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`).                                            | `3010`                                  |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST`           | Host address for the HTTP server (if `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`).                                    | `127.0.0.1`                             |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`     | Comma-separated allowed origins for CORS (if `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`).                            | (none)                                  |
| `MCP_SERVER_NAME`         | Optional server name (used in MCP initialization).                                                  | (from package.json)                     |
| `MCP_SERVER_VERSION`      | Optional server version (used in MCP initialization).                                               | (from package.json)                     |
| `MCP_LOG_LEVEL`           | Server logging level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, etc.).                                   | `debug`                                 |
| `LOGS_DIR`                | Directory for log files.                                                                            | `logs/` (in project root)               |
| `NODE_ENV`                | Runtime environment (`development`, `production`).                                                  | `development`                           |
| `MCP_AUTH_SECRET_KEY`     | **Required for HTTP transport.** Secret key (min 32 chars) for signing/verifying auth tokens (JWT). | (none - **MUST be set in production**)  |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`      | API key for OpenRouter.ai service. Optional, but service will be unconfigured without it.           | (none)                                  |
| `LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL`       | Default model to use for LLM calls via OpenRouter.                                                  | `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` |
| `LLM_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE` | Default temperature for LLM calls (0-2). Optional.                                                  | (none)                                  |

**Note on HTTP Port Retries:** If the `MCP_HTTP_PORT` is busy, the server automatically tries the next port (up to 15 times).

**Security Note for HTTP Transport:** When using `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`, authentication is **mandatory** as per the MCP specification. This template includes JWT-based authentication middleware (`src/mcp-server/transports/authentication/authMiddleware.ts`). You **MUST** set a strong, unique `MCP_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` in your production environment for this security mechanism to function correctly. Failure to do so will result in bypassed authentication checks in development and fatal errors in production.
